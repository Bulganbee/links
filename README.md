<h2>Links Project</h2>
<p>
For this project, Amely Richter and I collected over 40+ media files under the theme of <i>Design born & raised in NYC</i> on an API platform called Are.na. 
Then, I designed and coded a website to showcase the collection. 
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The website must be responsive.</li>
  <li>You must link your assets from Are.na, not from your local files.</li>
  <li>The website design must reflect the theme of the media collection.</li>
  <li>This will be your first website to use Javascript in order to link assets and make the website interactive.</li>
</ul>
