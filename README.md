<h1>Motion of NYC</h1>
<p>
The <i>Links</i> is a project from the <i>Typography and Interaction</i> program within MPS Communication Design at Parsons, led by professors Michael Fehrenbach and Eric Li. At the start, Amely Richter and I collected over 60+ media files under the theme of <i>Motion of NYC</i> on an API platform called Are.na. 
Then, I designed, curated and coded a website to showcase the collection.</p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The website must be responsive.</li>
  <li>You must link your assets from Are.na, not from your local files.</li>
  <li>The website design must reflect the theme of the media collection.</li>
  <li>This will be your first website to use Javascript in order to link assets and make the website interactive.</li>
</ul>
